# lune-vscode
Official VS Code syntax highlighting plugin for Lune. Provides basic highlighting
and support for commenting with `Ctrl+/` based on the TextMate language.

Since the language is still in development, this will probably change a *lot*.

## What this extension isn't?
This extension isn't a complete development environment/IDE for Lune and only
provides the bare minimum syntax highlighting and smart brace/commenting to make writing
code tolerable.

## Installing
Copy this extension folder to `$HOME/.vscode/extensions` or `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
if you use Windows. 

From then on, VS Code will treat `.ln` and `.lune` files as Lune code.
